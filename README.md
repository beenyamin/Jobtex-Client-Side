*JWT (JSON Web Token):

JWT is a compact, self-contained way to represent information between parties as a JSON object.
It's commonly used for user authentication and authorization in web applications.
JWTs consist of three parts: header, payload, and signature.
They are often sent as tokens in HTTP headers or cookies for secure communication.
JWTs are stateless and do not require server-side storage.

*Axios:

Axios is a popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests.
It simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests and handling responses.
Axios supports various HTTP methods, request and response interceptors, and can be used in both browsers and Node.js.
It provides a promise-based API for asynchronous requests.
Axios is highly customizable and widely used in web development.

*React Hook:

React Hooks are functions that allow functional components to use state and other React features.
They were introduced in React 16.8 and provide an alternative to class components.
Common hooks include useState, useEffect, useContext, and more.
Hooks improve code reusability, simplifying complex component logic.
They make it easier to manage component state and side effects in a functional way.

*Firebase:

Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform by Google.
It offers a suite of cloud-based services, including authentication, databases, storage, and hosting.
Firebase Realtime Database is a NoSQL, real-time database for syncing data across clients.
Firebase Authentication provides user management and authentication services.
Firebase Cloud Functions allow developers to run serverless code in response to events.

*Custom Hook (in React):

Custom hooks are reusable functions that encapsulate logic for specific use cases.
They help extract and share stateful and side-effect code across components.
Custom hooks enhance code organization and promote reusability.
Hooks can be created and used in functional components, extending their capabilities.
Naming custom hooks with a "use" prefix is a common convention in React development.
